I think we can work more efficiently in the current world and there are lots of new way to develop better software fast at a lower cost.

This Project will be a great solution for those who want to hire freelancers for a month or several months. By this solution there is no worry about hiring and contract for them and the only important thing is defining the idea or task that they need to be done.

Usage for those who have an idea which they want to  start:

They can simply create a project and describe their idea. After that software team will give them an analysis of different parts of the idea.

- Report of the different milestone
- Developers and software engineers that are required for the project 
- Cost estimate
- Time estimate



Main  idea in this project is you can hire developers in this platform after that


- Create project
- Analysis of different parts
- Hire  
- Add task 
- Get resualt (repository & CI/CD & report & Source files)
